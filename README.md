# wrlliam/scripts

This is a repo holding most/all of my scripts (both proxmox and not.)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wrlliam/scripts
cd scripts
sudo chmod +x scripts/*
```

or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wrlliam/scripts && cd scripts && sudo chmod +x scripts/*
```

_Some of this may be a WIP and im not responable if it messed up your system - read the source next time._
